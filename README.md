# Real_Face_Mask_Detection
This project is a real-time Face Mask Detection System built using OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and a pre-trained deep learning model. It uses your webcam to detect faces and classify each face as “Mask” or “No Mask”.

Features

Real-time webcam detection

Uses Haar Cascade for fast face detection

Deep Learning model (Keras .h5 file) for mask classification

Bounding boxes and labels drawn on each detected face

Works on CPU (no GPU required)

Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

TensorFlow / Keras

Pre-trained model: mask_detector.h5


This project is open-source.
